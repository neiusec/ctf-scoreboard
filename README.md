# CTF Scoreboard Application

This is a reusuable application used to host a Capture the Flag Scoreboard Application. This can be used while hosting a CTF contest so that people playing the CTF can submit flags, read scope rules, and view flag missions. Administrator accounts will be able to add, remove, and manage users and flags.
